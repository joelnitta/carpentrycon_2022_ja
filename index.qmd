## Translation: Summary

- Green stickies :green_heart:
  - GitHub works well for collaboration
  - Can do translation review in browser

- Red stickies :x:
  - Requirement for git knowlege is a very **high barrier to participation**
  - **Leads to burnout** because only a few members can contribute

## Translation: Future Plans

- Plan to switch to upcoming "Workbench" format and new translation system

- For more info, see [https://joelnitta.github.io/carpentrycon_2022_trans](https://joelnitta.github.io/carpentrycon_2022_trans)

## Outreach

- Members promote Carpentries at their institutions

- Present at lab meetings, meetups

## Current status of SWC-JA

- 30 members on Slack (ca. 6 core)

- 1 lesson fully translated

- 1 workshop held in Japanese

- 0 member organizations

## Key points

- Translation is a **prerequisite**

- **Online participation** key to making workshop possible

- Building a Carpentries community from zero is **hard**
  - Tough to "sell" the concept (lack of cultural familiarity)
  - Community members not in a position to establish Carpentries in local institutions
  - Need better outreach **at higher levels**
